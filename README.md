This Project aims to develop an efficient and accurate system for detecting vehicle license plates in real-time using the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm. This system will leverage state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to identify and locate license plates(UK) of vehicles and get the license plate number in text format using EasyOCR.
